Known errors: Left shadow is too dark while right shadow is correct, computing reflections causes black lines all over image.

If you wish to see the image without reflections implemented (which looks a lot better), look for the block of code enclosed in lines of comment stars in the trace() method.
Then remove the first / from the two lines of stars to comment out the whole block. Running the program will then show the image with just shading and shadows.
